## DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF EFFICIENT ALGORITHM FOR DELIVERY SYSTEM


Transportation of goods is an important task in today's online business. 
Companies like Amazon, Flipkart, DHL and Fedex need to send packages from one place to another on 
a regular basis.The customers receive their packages 
within one to two days. Amazon and other company’s goal is to make 
sure their customer’s delivery requests succeed their expectations. In 
order to accomplish this goal huge amount of money is spent by Amazon 
Delivery service daily on fuel, equipment, maintenance of equipment 
and wages. “Using the most efficient route to deliver packages can 
drastically reduce the cost such as time and money”.

## PROBLEM

This problem can be divided into two sub problems. 
1) There might be given list of several amazon delivery centres for cities in India, so in 
which delivery centre is responsible for particular package? 

This solution to this question is relatively very simple. Each delivery centre can be made 
responsible for a particular set of zip codes and the package belonging to a particular zip code 
can be routed to its corresponding delivery centre. 

2) What is an efficient route or path to dispatch packages to delivery centre and deliver to 
set of addresses from delivery centre to customer? 

The solution to this question is by finding shortest route from several routes to deliver a set of 
packages in best order. This can be termed as Traveling Salesman Problem.
